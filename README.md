1. Upon starting the application, the players will be asked to enter their names. After their names are entered, the game screen (seen above) will be displayed.
2. To play the game, the players must enter the number associated with the square they would like to place their marker in (player 1 is X, player 2 is O). The game continues until one player wins by placing three of their markers in a row, or until there are no moves remaining. 
3. After the game is completed, the players will then be asked if they would like to play the game again. Choosing not to play the game again will close the application.
